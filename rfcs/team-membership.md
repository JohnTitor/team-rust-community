# Team composition

This document aims to formalize the procedures for getting membership in the Rust
community team.

------

In general, we should encourage participation from community members who are not part of the team,
as outlined in the [observer policy](observer-policy.md).

In some cases such participating members may have enough involvement that we feel it advatageous to
include them in the team. Some reasons for doing this may be:

 - Recognition: If someone is especially active in this space, it is worth adding them to the team to recognize them.
 - "Officializing": For some tasks, like talking with other companies, it is useful to be able to say you are "X of the Rust Community Team"

Most community team activities should be designed such that as much as possible, team membership is not required.

To add someone as a member, they need to be nominated by an existing member on the private community team mailing list.
Team members can voice approval/objections, and come to consensus on the topic. Consensus is judged by the community team lead.
In general for team additions this will skew towards there being unanimous approval with at worst minor concerns.

(NOTE: With the advent of subteams this may include relevant subteam leaders for judging consensus)

Voluntarily leaving the team can be done by contacting the community team lead or mailing list. If you wish to re-join
afterwards you will have to be nominated again.
