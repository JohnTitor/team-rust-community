# Observer policy

This document aims to formalize our meeting structure with respect to external observers and participants.

-----

Meetings are open by default. Specific topics may require a more closed video meeting or a meeting
in a private channel, but in general we should hold our meetings in public.

Non-team folks can drop by and take part in discussions if they wish, however they may be asked to
wait till later to say their bit in case it's not the topic being discussed. This puts them at the same level as
team members during an open team meeting. We can tweak this on a per case
basis; if we're running out of time and need team feedback we can ask them to wait till later
even if on topic.

If someone not from the team wishes to lead or participate in an agenda item, they may comment on
the agenda issue or ask a team member to set it up for them. We try to give priority to agenda items
involving such guests, since they may not be able to make it for other meetings.

If a member has an agenda item you're leading in a meeting, a couple days before the meeting they
should try to consider if there are non-team members you'd want to be there, and invite them if so
(mentioning that they have been invited in the issue).
