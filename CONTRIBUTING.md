# Contributing

This repo is primarily for organization purposes so we are not likely to accept
PRs for new documents or prose from members outside the team itself. However, if
you find a typo, we welcome PRs from all folks and will be happy to walk you 
through the process of fixing it.

## RFCs

We add policies to this repo through a very minimal RFC process. RFCs live in the
`/rfcs` directory. To make an RFC for a new policy:

1. Start a discussion issue and bring up the issue at a general meeting. 
1. (optionally) If the issue is large enough, schedule a time for a voice chat
  to discuss the issue.
1. Make a PR with the new policy. This could be one or more files depending on the
  change you would like to make.
1. We are not strict about comment periods. Usually an RFC is open for 1-2 iterations
  of the General Meeting, and/or until there has been consensus. We'll usually
  approve merging the RFC in a General Meeting by adding it to the agenda.
