# Rust Community Team
> Leader: Ashley Williams ([@ashleygwilliams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams))

This repository is the home to the [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org)
Community Team. We use this repo to track meeting agendas, new ideas, and concerns
that cut across our various [subteams](#subteams).

## Get Involved!

### 💕 Participate in a Subteam

Working with or joining a Subteam is the best way to get involved with the Rust
Community team. Subteams are subject focused and bring together people who are
invested in managing and producing awesome events, content, workshops and more!

See more on subteams [below](#subteams).

### 🏢 Attend a General Meeting

The Rust Community Team meets every other Wednesday, 5PM UTC on the the mozilla.org
IRC network in the #rust-community channel. These meetings are treated as a standup
for the subteams, though we occasionally host guests. Before you consider joining a
general meeting- take a look at the [Subteams](#subteams) to get a sense for what
sort of work is being done!

If you don't have an irc client you can access it via [Mibbit](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-community). The meeting agendas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncFvzgb85ay5lNECV6myw4uOv5rjsvtyoLcgyQTJZ9E/edit?usp=sharing).

If you would like to attend, please read our [Observer Policy](/rfcs/observer-policy.md).

## Subteams

The subteams are the best way to get involved in the Community Team. You can learn
more about each team by visiting it's repository, reading it's goal document, or 
messaging it's Team Lead. You can find all the details below- we're excited to hear from
you!

### 🗓️ Events

The events team helps events to get better in touch with the rest of the community. We advise and bring you in contact with other organisers. The events team are also the ones to approach if you want to get you meetup featured on the events calendar and subsequently the newsletter.

We are hoping to find new members around the globe, especially outside of Europe and the US.
