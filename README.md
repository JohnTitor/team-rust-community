# Rust Language Community Team

This is the main repository for tracking the results of the [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org)
community team's global outreach efforts.  If you would like to participate in any of the projects,
or propose a new one, please either start a conversation on
[users.rust-lang.org/c/community](https://users.rust-lang.org/c/community),
or open an [issue](https://github.com/rust-community/team/issues).  We'd love to hear from you. 

The team meets on Wednesdays at 5PM UTC on the the mozilla.org irc network in the #rust-community channel. If you don't have an irc client you can access it via [Mibbit](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-community). The meeting agendas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncFvzgb85ay5lNECV6myw4uOv5rjsvtyoLcgyQTJZ9E/edit?usp=sharing).
